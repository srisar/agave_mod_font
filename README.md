# agave font with small modifications

This is a customized version of my beloved font "Agave - A succulent font that looks so, so much better"

Few things like, numbers, and symbols such as (),[],{}  looked so much better in another old school monospaced font - Monaco. So, I mixed both of them together to build this font. 

Newly added symbols are adjusted to make it compatible with current agave letters and spacing.

Since agave only have regular without bold or italic, I have also created faux italic and bold version so IDE editors does not render them improperly.

You can find the fonts in the build folder.
